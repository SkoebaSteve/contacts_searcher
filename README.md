# contacts_searcher

A simple, clean contact search directory with ES6, Webpack and React.

To run it, use the mock data in the `/api` folder with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to compile a build version.

For the dev version, use `npm run dev` and to see the compiled tests(Jest and Enzyme snapshots) use `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch`
